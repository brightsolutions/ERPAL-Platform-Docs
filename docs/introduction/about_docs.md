### Adding youtube videos
to add youtube-videos to a documentation-page please insert them as an iframe with the `youtube-iframe` class. 
this way the width is flexible and the videos should be shown properly.

for example:

    <iframe class="youtube-iframe" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A5rx_UoQXf8"></iframe>
